/**
 * @title Special withdrawals
 * @notice There are some cases where we might want to perform a special withdrawal. For example, if a
 *         token only supports a delayed withdrawal, we might want to withdraw the farm token directly and
 *         sell it on the market, instead of waiting for the normal process.
 *         Since each strategy could support different types of withdrawals, we need to define a "protocol"
 *         on how to execute and interpret each of them. Input and output are encoded as bytes, in here we'll
 *         specify how to encode/decode them.
